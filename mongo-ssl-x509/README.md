# MongoDB 2-Way SSL/x509 Role-Based Access Control
## WARNING
Do not use the certificates and keys in this directory in a production system.  These are for demonstration and testing purposes only.  If you wish to setup MAGE and MongoDB to use 2-way SSL this way, **YOU MUST GENERATE YOUR OWN KEYS AND CERTIFICATES!**  All of these keys are unencrypted and publicly available on Github, and using them would make your system vulnerable to attack.
